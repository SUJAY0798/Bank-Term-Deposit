**Summary**

1. Introduction,

The main objective of this business problem is to find the factors that have led the customers to close their accounts and also predict the potential customers who will in future close their account beforehand so that bank can offer more benefits to keep the customers active.

The bank has experienced record levels of customers closing their credit accounts in the past couple of years and this is leading to declining revenue.Therefore, the bankâ€™s goal is to predict these customers and hold them from closing the account so that their financial losses are minimized.

2. Highlights and key findings.

From the analysis in question 1 we can see that the customers who closed their accounts were maximum in the blue card type. More than half of the customers who closed their accounts had blue credit card. These might be because the offers and rewards for blue type credit card are not very impressive, and customers are not satisfied with it. 

From the histogram we can observe that the customers who closed accounts where inactive for three months in the previous. Almost 1100 customers out of 2000 were inactive for three months last year. These may be due to some financial crisis the customers were going through and so might be thinking of closing the credit card account.

Further analyzing the data, we observe that the customers with part-time employment status are the highest customers who have closed their accounts. Job uncertainty, low income might be the reasons why they cannot afford the credit card and had to close their accounts. Also, amongst all the employment type full time customers have the highest number of active accounts.

Moreover, the maximum customers who closed credit card accounts were contacted only three times last year. There are more active customers who were contacted three or less times. Therefore, the number of times customers were contacted last year does not have any influence on the customers closing their accounts or staying active.

According to the Box plot, the median income of active customers is slightly higher than the median income of customers who have closed their accounts. Thus, it does not imply that customers with high salaries have active credit accounts because the difference is very small.

3. Best Classification Model.

After using different machine learning models such as decision tree, random forest, and logistic regression to predict the customer status we can conclude that random forest performs better than other models. The accuracy of random forest is 95% and the recall is 95% (which means that for every 100 customers who are closing the account our model will catch 95 customers accurately) which is a perfect model for bank. 
Therefore, in this case Random Forest is the best model to use for predicting the customers who will close their accounts in future.

4. Recommendations.

Firstly, I would recommend the bank to upgrade the offers, rewards and benefits on blue credit card. This would attract the customers and use the card more often. Also, these might help the bank to retain their customers and maximize their financial revenue.

Second, the bank should contact the customers who are inactive for more than two months and check in if anything is wrong with there credit card. Also provide some cashback offers to lure the customers in using their credit card on at least basic amenities.
